You are welocme to check the summary of my work

Part 1: I only used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build the project.
	I used two button +/- to zoom in and out the image.
	I used scroll horizontal and vertical. 
	No more than 3 zoom in. 
	Extra zoom out will make image disappear.

Part 2: I set the width of the <div> that contains the images to automatic so it can hold the horizontal overflow.
	No white space nor line breaks between images.
	I used nested for loops to get images URLs.
	I remove any images in the block before and after I click +/-.
	Used scale property to scale the whole block 1.5 times to the left when hovering over it.
	
Part 3: I am working on 'Panning' at the moment. 
	I work to enhance the layout of the webpage and scrolling on x,y axis.
	I will respond to comments wisley.
	I work to write Clean Code and add documentation.
